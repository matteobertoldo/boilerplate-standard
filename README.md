# Boilerplate Standard
> "Definitely the standard üëåüèΩ for start front end Web projects".

From a `UI-Kit` up in `Production`. "Boilerplate Standard" is an excellent friend to develop, compile, compress files for the front end Web developing dynamically...but not only. With more than **100** options for different tasks, your work environment will be dynamic as ever.

Great for developing static template but at the same time great to "interpose" across multiple development platforms like Wordpress, Shopify, Magento, Demandware and many more.
